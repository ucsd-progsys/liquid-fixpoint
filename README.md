Liquid Fixpoint [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucsd-progsys/liquid-fixpoint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ucsd-progsys/liquid-fixpoint)
===============


This package implements a Horn-Clause/Logical Implication constraint solver used
for various Liquid Types. The solver uses SMTLIB2 to implement an algorithm similar to:

+ [Houdini](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~cormac/papers/fme01.pdf)
+ [cartesian predicate abstraction](http://swt.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/berit/papers/boolean-and-cartesian-....pdf)


Requirements
------------

In addition to the .cabal dependencies you require an SMTLIB2 compatible solver binary:

- [Z3](http://z3.codeplex.com)
- [CVC4](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu) 
- [MathSat](http://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.html)

If on Windows, please make sure to place the binary and any associated DLLs somewhere 
in your path.

How To Build and Install
------------------------

Simply do:

    git clone https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquid-fixpoint.git
    cd liquid-fixpoint
    stack install

or (`cabal` instead of `stack` if you prefer.)


Using SMTLIB-based SMT Solvers
------------------------------

You can use one of several SMTLIB2 compliant solvers, by:

    fixpoint --smtsolver=z3 path/to/file.hs

Currently, we support

    * Z3
    * CVC4
    * MathSat



Configuration Management
------------------------

It is very important that the version of Liquid Fixpoint be maintained properly.

Suppose that the current version of Liquid Haskell is `A.B.C.D`:

+ After a release to hackage is made, if any of the components `B`, `C`, or `D` are missing, they shall be added and set to `0`. Then the `D` component of Liquid Fixpoint shall be incremented by `1`. The version of Liquid Fixpoint is now `A.B.C.(D + 1)`

+ The first time a new function or type is exported from Liquid Fixpoint, if any of the components `B`, or `C` are missing, they shall be added and set to `0`. Then the `C` component shall be incremented by `1`, and the `D` component shall stripped. The version of Liquid Fixpoint is now `A.B.(C + 1)`

+ The first time the signature of an exported function or type is changed, or an exported function or type is removed (this includes functions or types that Liquid Fixpoint re-exports from its own dependencies), if the `B` component is missing, it shall be added and set to `0`. Then the `B` component shall be incremented by `1`, and the `C` and `D` components shall be stripped. The version of Liquid Fixpoint is now `A.(B + 1)`

+ The `A` component shall be updated at the sole discretion of the project owners.

It is recommended to use the [Bumper](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bumper) utility to manage the versioning of Liquid Fixpoint. Bumper will automatically do the correct update to the cabal file. Additionally, it will update any packages that you have the source for that depend on Liquid Fixpoint.

To update Liquid Fixpoint and Liquid Haskell, first clone Liquid Haskell and Liquid Fixpoint to a common location:

```
git clone https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell.git
git clone https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquid-fixpoint.git
```

To increment the `D` component of Liquid Fixpoint:

```
./path/to/bumper -3 liquid-fixpoint
```

This will update the `D` component of Liquid Fixpoint. If necessary, this will update the `Build-Depends` of Liquid Haskell. If the `Build-Depends` was updated, Liquid Haskell's `D` component will be incremented.

To increment the `C` component of Liquid Fixpoint, and strip the `D` component:

```
./path/to/bumper --minor liquid-fixpoint
```

As before, this will update Liquid Fixpoint and, if necessary, Liquid Haskell.

To increment the `B` component of Liquid Fixpoint, and strip the `D` and `C` components:

```
./path/to/bumper --major liquid-fixpoint
```

As before, this will update Liquid Fixpoint and, if necessary, Liquid Haskell

SMTLIB2 Interface
-----------------

There is a new SMTLIB2 interface directly from Haskell:

+ Language.Fixpoint.SmtLib2

See `tests/smt2/{Smt.hs, foo.smt2}` for an example of how to use it.

Options
-------

`--extsolver` runs the **deprecated** external solver.

`--parts` Partitions an `FInfo` into a `[FInfo]` and emits a bunch of files. So:

    $ fixpoint -n -p path/to/foo.fq

will now emit files:

    path/to/.liquid/foo.1.fq
    path/to/.liquid/foo.2.fq
    . . .
    path/to/.liquid/foo.k.fq

and also a dot file with the constraint dependency graph:

    path/to/.liquid/foo.fq.dot
